# VRCBadge

<img src="./images/rfid-namecard.png" alt="RFID Namecard">

I made RFID namecard before (for friends and myself)<br>
and you know, all VRC players change avatar quite often.

After making those namecards 3 times (dumb),<br>
I decided to make a digital badge for myself. (simple + fun toy project!)

It's gonna be a wearable digital badge powered by ESP32-S3<br>
Namecard looking UI (Yes, changeable image ofc)<br>
editable profile information (twitter, discord etc..), and future RFID door key emulation.

This project is inspired by Github Conference Badge video, posted by Wes Bos. [Ref Video](https://youtu.be/_jPm_zN95FE?si=vHjaHDR8lpRF7iKP)
